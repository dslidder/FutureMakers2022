# FutureMakers2022

7/6
Learned about the general structure of Futuremakers colab notebooks
Learned about numpy and pandas.
Was a bit more challenging than I expected-- I'm actually quite rusty with Python!-- but I enjoyed having to figure things out instead of copying and pasting code or being told exactly what to do
